# 见证人简介
# Introduction to Witness
## 见证人职能
## Functions of Witness
YOYOW 采用的是 DPoS + PoS灵活选择的共识机制，见证人充当传统的区块链项目中“矿工”角色。

YOYOW uses a consensus mechanism for flexible selection of DPoS + PoS, and witnesses act as “miners” in traditional blockchain projects.

其核心职责为打包交易（俗称“出块”），维护网络稳定运行； 
见证人出块享有系统给予的奖励。  

Its core responsibility is packaging transactions (commonly known as “producing blocks”) to maintain a stable network operation; witnesses enjoy the rewards given by the system.
## 见证人资格（抵押）
## Witness Qualification (Collateral)
任何账户抵押一定数量的YOYO ，即可成为见证人。抵押最小值，当前设置10000 YOYO，见证人可随时调整抵押金额。

Any account with collateral over a certain amount of YOYO can become a witness. Current minimum value for collateral: 10,000 YOYO. Witnesses are free to adjust the amount of collateral at any time.

注册见证人操作需要消耗1000 YOYO， 抵押最小值10000 YOYO，因此成为见证人也至少需要11000 个 YOYO。

The operation of witness registration costs 1000 YOYO, and the minimum value for collateral is 10000 YOYO, so at least 11,000 YOYO are required to become witnesses.

## 见证人产生方式
## Ways to Become Witnessess
YOYOW的见证人产生有两种方式  
1. 投票选举
2. 抵押YOYOW

There are two ways to become witnesses of YOYOW:  
1. voting election
2. YOYOW collateral

通过以上两种方式，共有3种见证人类型：

There are three types of witnesses in the above two ways:

1. 主力见证人：由持币人直接投票产生，按“有效得票数”排名，前 11 名 
Top witnesses: directly voted in by token holders, ranked according to the number of "effective votes", being top 11.

2. 备选见证人：由持币人直接投票产生，按“有效得票数”排名，前 11 名之外的，其他所有候选人按得票数量加权，轮流上岗。当前为第12～14名，每轮选出3位。
Standby witnesses: directly voted in by token holders, ranked according to the number of "valid votes" and all other candidates apart from the top 11 are weighted according to the number of votes, taking turns to work alongside the top witnesses. Currently, three candidates ranked 12th to 14th are selected in each round.

3. 矿工见证人：按抵押排名产生，按“有效抵押金额”加权，轮流上岗。如：只有ABC三人抵押，其中A有效抵押6个币，B有效抵押3个币，C有效抵押1个币，那么在后续100个块中，应该安排A出块60个，B出块30个，C出块10个。矿工见证人每轮选出7位。 
Miner witnesses: generated by collateral ranking, weighted according to "valid collateral amount", taking turns to work. For example, if A, B and C all deposit collateral, and A has six tokens of valid collateral, B has three tokens of valid collateral, and C has one token of valid collateral, then, for the following 100 blocks, it should be arranged that A produces 60 blocks, B produces 30 blocks and C produces 10 blocks. Seven miner witnesses are selected in each round.

综上： YOYOW的见证人产生机制是根据“得票数”与“抵押数”的情况，预先选出21位见证人（11+3+7）。 选出的见证人轮流出块，一轮时间约为63秒，当21位见证人都出块完毕时，自动进行下一轮的选举。
To sum up: YOYOW's witness generation mechanism is based on the "number of votes" and "collateral number", pre-selecting 21 witnesses (11 + 3 + 7). The selected witnesses take turns to producing blocks, and the round of time is about 63 seconds. When 21 witnesses finish producing blocks, the next round of elections will be automatically carried out.

## 见证人工资
## Rewards of Witnesses
每出一块，出块见证人获得相应工资/奖励。

Witnesses will get corresponding rewards every time a block is produced.

按照当前理事会决议：

- 主力见证人：每块工资0.3 YOYO
- 备选见证人：每块工资0.3 YOYO
- 矿工见证人：每块工资 0.5 YOYO 

According to the resolution of the current committee:

- Top witnesses: 0.3 YOYO for each block
- Standby witnesses: 0.3 YOYO for each block
- Miner witnesses: 0.5 YOYO for each block

工资计入见证人的“待领取工资”，见证人可随时将“待领取工资”领取到自己的余额内。

Witnesses can withdraw “available” rewards into their balance at any time.

## 见证人作恶惩罚机制
## Penalty Mechanism for Witnesses
- 双花企图嫌疑：如果一个见证人在同一高度出两个块，则认为有嫌疑企图制造分叉、实施双花攻击。

- Under suspicion of an attempt to double spend: If a witness has two blocks at the same height, it is suspected of attempting to create forks and implement a double spend attack.

- 如果网络检测到这种情况，或者有人举报，记录证据后，见证人强制离线，同时扣除部分押金。

- If the network detects this situation, or if someone reports it, after the evidence is recorded, the witness is forced to go offline and some deposits are deducted.

- 暂无举报奖励
- No rewards for reporting for the time being

## 见证人离线
## Witnesses being Offline
- 主动离线：需要临时维护时，见证人可以主动设置暂时离线

- Go Offline on one's own：witnesses can set up a temporary offline status on their own when temporary maintenance is required.

- 强制离线：当见证人丢块时，如果上次出块时间在24小时外，该见证人自动设置为暂时离线，不再安排后续出块，位置由排名靠后的补上

- Go offline forcibly: When the witnesses lose blocks, if the last time of the block production is earlier than 24 hours before, the witness is automatically set to be temporarily offline with no further block production arranged, and the position is replaced by the witness of a lower rank.

- 见证人手动重新在线后，即可重新参与后续出块安排
- Witnesses can be arranged in the later block production if the witnesses reset an online status manually.
