# 平台简介
# Introduction to the Platform

平台是 YOYOW 网络中提供内容存储、用户交互、授权登陆等服务的服务提供商，第三方可通过抵押 YOYO 代币成为平台，同时理事会有权利在平台违反社区共识/条例时吊销平台资格并处以其他处罚。

The platform is a service provider that provides content storage, user interaction, authorized login and other services in the YOYOW network. The third party can become a platform through the collateral of YOYO tokens, and the committee has the right to revoke the qualification of the platform  and impose other penalties when the platform violates the community consensus/regulation.

## 用户授权平台
## Users Authorizing the Platform
普通用户可以通过YOYOW钱包对平台进行授权，可以授权平台代理使用其鉴权权限，该权限可用于进行跨站点登录、单点登录等，共享YOYOW生态中的所有用户。

Common users can authorize the platform through the YOYOW wallet, and can authorize the platform proxies to use its authentication authority, which can be used for cross-site login, single sign-on, etc., sharing all users in the YOYOW ecosystem.

用户授权本质上是指普通账户将零钱权限授予平台，普通账户可以在平台构建的生态中进行小额的“免密支付”，帮助平台快速拥有流通性较强的Token。平台也可以使用自己发行的Token，参见[用户发行资产](../asset/uia.html)

User authorization essentially means that the common account grants the authority of the liquid assets to the platform, and the common account can carry out small amount "password-free payment" in the ecosystem constructed by the platform, helping the platform to quickly have Token of strong circulation. The platform can also use its own issued Token. Please refer to [UIA](../asset/uia.html). More information about user authorization can be found in [ForPlatforms](../others/forplatforms.html).
