# Bonus Points
Bonus Points are rewards for YOYO holders. When your account holds YOYO, Bonus Points will be accumulated over time. There is an upper limit for Bonus Points accumulated, and you have to withdraw Bonus Points manually.

## Using Bonus Points

At present, the only use of Bonus Points is for paying fees. You can use Bonus Points to offset fees. 100 Bonus Points can be used as 1 YOYO, under the circumstances.

## Acquisition of Bonus Points

- When the “balance” of your account reaches a certain amount of YOYO, the system will automatically accumulate Bonus Points for you.

- Bonus Points are withdrawn manually. You can manually withdraw available Bonus Points to your account.

- Rate of Credit Accumulation: the current setting allows you to withdraw Bonus Points equivalent to 1 YOYO per day for every 10,000 YOYO.

## Renting Bonus Points

A Bonus Point Rental function will be enabled in the future.

## Gifting Bonus Points

Currently, when implementing the “withdrawing Bonus Points” action, you are able to select the account of a contact and withdraw the Bonus Points into their accounts.
